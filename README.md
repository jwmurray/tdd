# Test Driven Development (TDD) examples in Rust

### TDD follows the simple but powerful cycle of 
1. Red -- Write a test that fails
2. Green -- Write just enough code to make the test work
3. Refactor -- clean up the code, eliminate duplicate code and clean up the comments and docs.

#### Key #1: Don't write a line of code that is not demanded by a failig test.
#### Key #2: Refactor to 
- remove duplicate code
- make unclear code clear
- make unclear tests clear

#### Key #3:  Use [cyber-dojo.org](https://cyber-dojo.org/creator/home) to find coding katas and practice every day for 30 minutesx
