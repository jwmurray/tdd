# Rust Test Driven Development (TDD) examples

### TDD follows the simple but powerful cycle of 
- Red -- Write a test that fails
- Green -- Write just enough code to make the test work
- Refactor -- clean up the code, eliminate duplicate code and clean up the comments and docs.

#### Key #1: Don't write a line of code that is not demanded by a failig test.
#### Key #2: Refactor to 
- remove duplicate code
- make unclear code clear
- make unclear tests clear

#### Key #3:  Use [cyber-dojo.org](https://cyber-dojo.org/creator/home) to find coding katas and practice every day for 30 minutes

## Soundex -- example translated from Jeff Langr's book Modern++ Programming with Test-Driven Development, (c) 2013
Soundex is a method of encoding English words into 4 character strings which can then be used for searching for words based on phonetic misspellings.
