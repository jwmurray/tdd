# Rust TDD examples

TDD follows the simple but powerful cycle of 
Red -- Write a test that fails
Green -- Write just enough code to make the test work
Refactor -- clean up the code, eliminate duplicate code and clean up the comments and docs.


## Soundex -- example translated from Jeff Langr's book Modern++ Programming with Test-Driven Development, (c) 2013
Soundex is a method of encoding English words into 4 character strings which can then be used for searching for words based on phonetic misspellings.
